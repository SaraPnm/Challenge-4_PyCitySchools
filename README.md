# Challenge 4 - School District Analysis

## Project Overview
We're helping a chief data scientists for a city school districts to analyze funding data and score data from several schools in the district. During the class we created district summary, school summary, reletive school performances, reading and math scores summaries by grade, shool spending, size, and type.

The goals of this challenge are to:

1. Correct the students' names so there are no professional prefixes or suffixes.
2. Replace the reading and math scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School with NaN.
3. Use loc on the student_data_df DataFrame to select the columns by condition.
4. Merge the clean student data with the school dataset.
5. After replacing the reading and math scores, answer the following questions:<br/>

    How is the district summary affected?<br/>
    How is the school summary affected?<br/>
    How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance, relative to the other schools?<br/>
    How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the Math and Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type?<br/>
